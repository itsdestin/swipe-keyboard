# Changes

## 0.1.0 — first public test release

- Standalone English (US) swipe typing for Plasma Keyboard; no Z13, touch-profile, theme or YouCoded dependency.
- Native Arch/CachyOS and Fedora 44 packages with compiled recognition code, models and dictionary. No user-side compilation or optional training-corpus download.
- Reversible per-user activation, compatibility checks, private layout regeneration, and preservation of later user setting changes.
- First ordinary Backspace after a swipe or candidate correction undoes that word when exact context is available. Further typing/cursor movement, selections and uncertain/sensitive context use normal deletion. Only swipe-generated spacing is undone.
- Launch waits briefly for setup to release its lock instead of spuriously falling back to stock during activation.
- Recording is opt-in, owner-only and excluded for sensitive/password input.
- Pinned/hash-checked model and build inputs, portable CPU defaults, corresponding source, third-party notices and native package CI checks.

### Known limits

- KDE Wayland, x86_64, Plasma Keyboard 6.7/6.8 candidate range; Qt major/minor must match the package. Initial native targets are current Arch and updated Fedora 44 KDE, not every Linux distribution or release ISO.
- English swipe recognition only. Application text-input support still affects keyboard summoning and editing.
- Firefox physical Ctrl+A/Delete may leave stale field context, causing an extra leading space on the next swipe. Accepted as a minor v1 limitation. Apps that hide or misreport their text cannot guarantee automatic word deletion/correction.
- Downloads are provided through GitHub Releases; no AUR/COPR package repository or automatic update feed is configured.
